Ignore #3. That does not work. Userspace expects to be able to rmdir on =
a tpg and that will remove the underlying sessions. If the session takes =
a ref to the tpg, then it breaks userspace because something now has to =
do the session removal before the tpg rmdir.




> 4. add some code and end up mix locking and state checks with =
refcounts. For example the tpg would have its configfs refcount like it =
does today (no new device struct in it), and when it deletes the =
sessions under it make sure the se_sess->se_tpg is NULL'd in a way that =
the session show function can do
