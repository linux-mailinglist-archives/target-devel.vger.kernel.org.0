Yes, there is such a risk. I was raising it in our company 2 years ago
when I did this patchset. We agreed that, until there is somebody who
can notice about it, it's OK :). It's happened not so often. There was
just one case when we changed RSOC structs - when I was adding support
of ACA condition.

Recently someone wants to have some defence against fuzzy-logic attacks,
may be he (or someone else) will intergate RSOC descriptors into
sbc_parse_cmd within his task.
