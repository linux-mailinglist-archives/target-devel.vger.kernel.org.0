Hi James,

That's a great question. With a driver that is closely related (the SCST
FCoE target driver; the driver from which the upstream tcm_fc driver has
been derived) I could trigger this race condition easily by running fio
--verify against the FCoE initiator driver. Changing "use_sg = !(remaining %
4) && lport->sg_supp" into "use_sg = false" made the fio verification errors
disappear.

Bart.
