Hi, we are running
*	QNAP NAS
*	Debian 10
*	Host VMware 6.7U3 Hypervisor

a) Exporting an iSCSI-LUN-target with the QNAP, what is using LIO therfor, and accessing it from VMware (read/write) works fine.
b) Exporting an iSCSI-LUN-target with a fresh Debian 10 using LIO and accessing it with a Windows 7 iSCSI initiator (read/write) works fine.

Using the target b) (Debian 10 / LIO) and the initiator a) (VMware v6.7) works as far as
*	VMware sees the target host
*	VMware can login and sees the target
*	VMware can READ the data on the LUN (sees partition table, size of it, partition types, etc)
 
As soon as we try to write anything VMware reports

and the Debian 10 box reports:

> kernel: [ 80.210044] TARGET_CORE[iSCSI]: Detected WRITE_PROTECTED LUN Access for 0x00000000

I don't recognize why VMware mounts the iSCSI LUN read-only but Windows 7 mounts it read-write and VMware mount the QNAP-iSCSI-LUN also read-write.

I appreciate any hint - thank you therfor in advance.
