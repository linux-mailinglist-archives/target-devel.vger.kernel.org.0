SAM-5 4.6.5.2 (Relative Port Identifier attribute) defines the attribute
as unique across SCSI target ports:
 The Relative Port Identifier attribute identifies a SCSI target port or
 a SCSI initiator port relative to other SCSI ports in a SCSI target
 device and any SCSI initiator devices contained within that SCSI target
 device. A SCSI target device may assign relative port identifiers to
 its SCSI target ports and any SCSI initiator ports. If relative port
 identifiers are assigned, the SCSI target device shall assign each of
 its SCSI target ports and any SCSI initiator ports a unique relative
 port identifier from 1 to 65 535. SCSI target ports and SCSI initiator
 ports share the same number space.

In the current TCM implementation, auto-incremented lun_rtpi weakly
follows the model outlined by SAM-5 and SPC-4. In case of multiple SCSI
target ports (se_portal_group's), which is common to scenario with
multiple HBAs or multiple iSCSI/FC targets, it's possible to have two
backstores (se_device's) with different values of lun_rtpi on the same
SCSI target port.

Similar issue happens during re-export. If a LUN of a backstore is
removed from a target port and added again to the same target port, RTPI
is incremented again and will be different from the first time.

The two issues happen because each se_device increments RTPI for its own
LUNs independently.

The behaviour means that a SCSI application client can't reliably make any
sense of RTPI values reported by a LUN as it's not really related to SCSI
target ports. A conforming target implementation must ensure that RTPI field is
unique per port. The patchset resolves the issue.

Make RTPI be part of se_tpg instead of se_lun. Make it configurable.
