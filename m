Hi Bart,

Could you please elaborate on how tape software will be broken?
I have no experience with tapes but I've looked into SSC-5 draft.

I haven't found anything concerning the writes but there are tape
variants of overflow/underflow for reads (G.3 General read rules) called
overlength and underlegth, respectively:

  If the read command requests fewer bytes than are available for
  transfer, then the read is an overlength read. If the read requests
  more bytes than are available, then the read is an underlength read.

  The amount of data returned is the smaller of the bytes available and
  the allocation length.

And the next paragraph defines cases where CHECK CONDITION should be
reported for such reads. However, GOOD status is also possible, the next
chapter of the annex (G.4 Examples from figure G.1 using variable-block
transfers and various SILI and BLOCK LENGTH settings) refines many cases
depending on SILI bit, whether block protection is enabled, if the
transfer is FIXED or variable-length and if BLOCK LENGTH is
zero/non-zero.

As far as I understand underlength and overlength are always suppressed
(status is GOOD) for devices where no "default" block size is defined
per SPC (7.5.7.1 General block descriptor format):

  For sequential access devices, a block length of zero indicates that the
  logical block size written to the medium is specified by the TRANSFER
  LENGTH field in the CDB (see SSC-4).

The cases are also summarized in annex D (D.3 Summary of length error
conditions on read type commands).

Note, that if we talk about SSC over FCP, then "9.4.2 FCP_DATA IUs for
read and write operations" does additionally apply. Perhaps a) from
"9.4.2 FCP_DATA IUs for read and write operations" works well for SSC:

  a) process the command normally except that data beyond the FCP_DL count
  shall not be requested or transferred;

The clause allows to accomodate variable-block tranfers from SSC.

So, what if we return CHECK CONDITION only for SBC WRITEs with
residuals?  Then it has no impact on SSC and other device types. In
future, we might also add a patch that would fail SBC READs with
residuals for sake of consistency. That behaviour would be beneficial
for SBC devices as no host could corrupt data or itself by forming,
requesting invalid data buffer.

Thanks,
Roman
