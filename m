In my private patchset there the third patch was with
target_stop_session/target_wait_for_sess_cmds right after
scsit_free_connection_recovery_entries(sess) from the second patch.
I did not post it because you are preparing a patchset with
target_wait_for_sess_cmds in iscsi.

Please, take my second patch to your patchset (if Martin will not take
it separately), it is definitely a bugfix.
But, please, take care that after
iscsit_free_connection_recovery_entries iscsi should wait for commands
complete too to fix that use-after-free completely.

Looking at the log snippet now I see that the call trace is not about
new command in the dead session. Because iscsi session is closed only
after both RX and TX threads have been stopped. It was a command in an
alive session.
Most likely, that call trace was due to the problem that I fixed in
dd0a66ada0bd ("scsi: target: core: Fix race during ACL removal") that
was catched on FC. And this one was on iSCSI. They are about the same
age.

I am dropping this (1st) patch as it is for an unreal case and actually does
not solve use-after-free session: iscsit_add_reject_cmd in the end calls
target_put_sess_cmd(se_cmd);
	target_free_tag(sess->se_sess, cmd);
    percpu_ref_put(&se_sess->cmd_count);
