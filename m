Ah I see. When I made the original comment and was asking about if the 
callback was supposed to perform some of the TMF operations I was 
thinking we were going to change up a lot of this code.

I think your idea where it's more of a way to notify the modules and we 
are not changing any of this behavior is better since no one wants to 
get into that :)

Seems ok to me.
