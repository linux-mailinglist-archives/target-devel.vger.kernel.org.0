I am not sure for all initiators, but usually it sends LUN_RESET only
after ABORT has been timed out. There is no reason to send a response on
the ABORT that was actually aborted already internally on the initiator
side.

I will vote to your old patch. qla2xxx was fixed long time ago. Other
fabric drivers have not that issue too. Only tcm_loop and xen still do
not adapted for parallel TMRs.

I think it's a not good idea to revert 2 years old patch. It was a
reason for some other patches (that fixes issues thanks to parallel TMR
handling).
