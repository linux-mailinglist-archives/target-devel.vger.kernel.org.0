My interpretation of the above text is that it neither allows nor
requires to change the status GOOD into something else if there is a
residue.

Thanks for the additional background information, this really helps. How
about only rejecting SCSI commands for which the data buffer size is not
a multiple of the block size? I'm concerned that flagging all SCSI
commands that have a residue as invalid will break SCSI tape software.

Thanks,

Bart.
