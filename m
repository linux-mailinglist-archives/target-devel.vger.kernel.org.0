I would normally stick with what's in the existing code, because it 
still says that the preferred limit is 80. For cases where readbility is 
an issue then I would go up to 100.

So, in future if we want to trace tmr request, then we may have to introduce new set of trace functions that do not reference cdb. What do you think?

I'm just talking about the LUN value and not the cdb here. In my opinion 
it's just a matter of initializing fields in transport_init_se_cmd that 
we later reference instead of having the initializations scattered 
around in multiple places.

I'm not talking about having a common trace function for the tmr and non 
tmr paths.

Also, for the cdb case the init in the target_cmd_init_cdb seems nice to 
me, because it's clear that is where we are setting up the cdb related 
fields.

Yeah, that's why I noticed the issue :) You didn't update the 
target_get_sess_cmd failure path to do 
transport_send_check_condition_and_sense even though you moved the cdb 
init before the get() call, so the code looked off.

Maybe you need a new trace call for the case where we can't fully 
initialize the cmd. It could be used for cases like where 
transport_generic_new_cmd is used directly but fails, the 
transport_handle_queue_full case, and your case where we fail during the 
initial setup.
