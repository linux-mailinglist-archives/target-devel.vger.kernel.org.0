Hi Martin,

The patch series contains fixes for qla2xxx and solves two visible
issues:
  - Target port in N2N topology doesn't perform login if it has higher
    WWPN than initiator
  - ABORT TASK TMF leads to crash if it's received shortly after ACL of
    an initiator is deleted and there's active I/O from the initiator

It also contains reliability improvements and cleanups.

Changes since v2 (https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11254937/):
- Target is allowed to perform PLOGI only if it detects N2N mode;
- Dropped patches to improve ABTS handling for ports that are not
  currently logged in. They will go into a separate patch series.
Changes since v1 (https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11141979/):
- Fixes target port in N2N mode were added (patches 5-11);
- Target port makes explicit LOGO on session teardown in the patch made
  by Quinn. Together with patch 1, it helps to immediately turn
  fc_remote_port to the Blocked stated on client side and avoids visibly
  stuck session;
- The last three patches address violation of FCP specification with
  regards to handling of ABTS-LS from ports that are not currently
  logged in.

Thank you,
Roman
