Yes, I mean the np_login_sem, right now I don't know for sure how easy
is to remove it, but I agree that probably there is room for improvement he=
re
and the login code can be simplified a lot.

Yeah, I guess that the author just wanted the login thread to go back to
kernel_accept() as fast as possible to be able to serve the next connection=
.
But yes, if the new connection is against the same tpg, the login
thread will have
to wait for the semaphore anyway.

Ok I think I could work on this new login code.
However, I would suggest to consider taking this patchset as a
stopgap, so the Delphix guys
can keep their customers happy and I can work on this
without feeling the pressure; also, this patchset is easier and safer
to backport to
stable kernels.
