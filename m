I am not sure that any kind of cluster configuration is available now.
Because RTPI (without my patchset) is not configurable and normally it
is the same on the ports(LUNs now) on different nodes. That prevents
a correct reporting of ports in RTPG.

Remote target patch is self-sufficient but it is not useful alone I think.
Together with RTPI patchset it allows to report in RTPG all ports in a
cluster.

I will send the remote target patch soon, but as I said, it is useful
only together with RTPI patchset (published but not yet merged to
scsi-queue).
