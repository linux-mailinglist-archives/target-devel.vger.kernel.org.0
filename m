We have been encountering the same issue with ESXi. For some reasons it
may not send an IO data for the already sent SCSI WRITE command - iSCSI
DataOUT PDUs. Instead, it send an ABORT for that command. Linux Target
Core does not abort a SCSI command when it has not yet full IO data
collected. iSCSI DataOut timer times out and triggers connection
reinstatement.
But during that reinstatement iSCSI hangs waiting for that aborted WRITE
command got completed. A not finished logout prevents a new login from
the same initiator.
That condition solves only by a target reboot.

I may just send you a patch for a target that fixes the hanging. ESXi
will reconnect to the target and will continue work with it without a
reboot.
