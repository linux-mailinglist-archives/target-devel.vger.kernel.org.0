Hi Martin,

This patch series only fixes a crash when there's active I/O and ACL of
the initiator is getting deleted. The issue can be reproduced quite
easily:

  1. Configure a target with 1 LUN and 1 ACL (and 1 Mapped LUN inside)
  2. Run I/O from initiator
  3. Delete ACL while running the I/O

The crash happens ~30s after the ACL is deleted when the initiator
starts sending ABORT TASK TMF to abort timed out I/O. It might happen at
rmmod time but that's just coincidence of ABORT TASK being processed. It
might not happen if a rig shuts off in less than 30 seconds.

Thanks,
Roman
