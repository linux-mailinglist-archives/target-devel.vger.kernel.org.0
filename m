By permanent condition SBC-3 means that an initiator should not resend
the command immediately as it will fail again. Kernel tries hard not to
fail with BLK_STS_NOSPC:

  /*
   * We're holding onto IO to allow userland time to react.  After the
   * timeout either the pool will have been resized (and thus back in
   * PM_WRITE mode), or we degrade to PM_OUT_OF_DATA_SPACE w/ error_if_no_space.
   */
  static void do_no_space_timeout(struct work_struct *ws)

So BLK_STS_NOSPC means that we are stuck with this condition and some
out-of-scope actions (like running fs-trim on the initiator) are
required.
