Hi Bart,

Thanks for raising the point about overlength/underlength. If you wish
we can add an extra check that fails DMA_TO_DEVICE && DATA with
residuals only for SBC devices but note that before the series,
underflow/overflow for WRITE didn't return GOOD status. The particular
patch only changes sense code to more meaningful from the former INVALID
FIELD IN CDB.

Theoretically, it could be good to have a configurable switch how LIO
handles overflows/underflows for a LUN. Then it'd be possible to
configure desired behaviour on a per-LUN basis. But there should be a
clear need & demand for the feature to avoid maintenance of dead code.

TBH I don't know any hosts that do SBC WRITE with residuals as normal
course of operation. They wouldn't be able to work with LIO because it
never returns GOOD status on WRITE with residuals. I can send an update
later if the series works fine with modern hosts (~1 month, after a few
cycles of system testing).

Fun fact, ~60 years ago WRITE overflows were used to achieve behaviour
similar to disk zeroing/WRITE SAME [1].
