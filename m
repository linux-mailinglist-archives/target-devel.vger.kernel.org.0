Not exactly. In case we are not able to fix a driver, I wanted to
change drivers's aborted_task callout to use its internal queue_tm_rsp
routines in case of aborted TMRs.
But that would work only if we changed the core to not call
target_put_sess_cmd, which again would lead to changes in currently
working drivers. Really a hack only.

Are we sure qla, loop and xen are the only drivers that handle aborted
TMRs incorrectly?
