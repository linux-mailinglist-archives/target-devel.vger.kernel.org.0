I think you might be right.

In the end as I needed to get this to work, I swapped Fedora for Ubuntu Server 20.0.4.2 LTS with the HWE kernel. 

Since I changed to Ubuntu I have not had any issues. I've tested hard reboots and unclean shut downs with no issue. Go figure... 

Fedora automatically loads the saved config using "targetctl restore", while on Ubuntu automatic restore is not enabled, so I added a cron @reboot line to do "targetcli restoreconfig /etc/target/myconfig.json". Perhaps that avoids some race  during boot? 

Are there any technical differences between "targetctl restore" and "targetcli restoreconfig saveconfig.json"

There are some other changes that might be the most important. "Emulate_write_cache" is now false and /sys/config show "mode:o_dsync" instead of "buffered-wce" .

Also, the "aio" attribute  is different. Perhaps I set it manually in Fedora, but I cannot remember. It is not visible in /sys but is in the saveconfig.json.
Ubuntu:
  "storage_objects": [
    {
      "aio": false,
Fedora:
  "storage_objects": [
    {
      "aio": true,

Does "aio" mean Async I/O in this case? I could not find any documentation for this attribute. What implication would this have with false vs true?

Thank you all for your inputs. I still would like to understand what wasn't right in the Fedora setup so that I might learn and avoid the specific pitfall in the future.
