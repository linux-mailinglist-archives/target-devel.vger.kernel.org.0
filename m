Yeah, we surely can't do that.

Actually the whole module renaming idea came to me after studying the
NVMe target code, because of how neatly the module names reflect the
code units. As for the SCSI target, maybe instead of using module names
we can do something similar to what device mapper does with DM_PREFIX
and get away with simply stating this in core modules:

  TARGET_PREFIX core

This in fabric modules:

  TARGET_PREFIX <fabric-name>

And this in backstore modules:

  TARGET_PREFIX <bs-name>

So the resulting messages would be something like this:

  target_err("This module blew up\n")
  [Thu May 11 00:00:00 2023] target iser: This module blew up

  target_sess_err(&se_sess, "Waiting for running cmds to complete.\n")
  [Thu May 11 00:00:00 2023] target iscsi [iqn.2023-01.com.example:blah-blah -> 10]: Waiting for running cmds to complete.

We can do the very same thing with this:

  pr_fmt(fmt) "target <fabric-name>": fmt

but then we will have one extra ":" here:

  target_sess_err(&se_sess, "Waiting for running cmds to complete.\n")
  [Thu May 11 00:00:00 2023] target iscsi: [iqn.2023-01.com.example:blah-blah -> 10]: Waiting for running cmds to complete.

Dunno how much of an OCD issue this is :D
