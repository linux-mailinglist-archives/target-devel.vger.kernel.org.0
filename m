This seems right, as the flag is checked again later in the same
function.

This comment addition seems redundant, isn't that what the "Immediate
Bit is not set" already means?

Are you sure this needs to be checking both conditions here?  I'm
struggling to understand why CmdSN checking would be bypassed for
immediate data.  Is this a longstanding bug where the condition should
have been on immediate_cmd (and only immediate_cmd) instead?

Or is this because of the handling the immediate data with DataCRC case
mentioned?  I do see iscsit_sequence_cmd also being called in
iscsit_get_immediate_data.
