Yes, I was thinking about that commit.

Yes, you are right, FW expects some response on every ABORT IOCB
to clear its resources.

I can prepare the patch for qla2xxx.

But still, I do not see a sense of new Bodo's solution.
Calling target_put_sess_cmd due to SCF_ACK_REF forbids any async long
term work in fabric drivers in aborted_task callback. It is
intentionally. qla2xxx does not require to wait for the completion of
all requests to FW. All terminate exchange requests are such.

SAM-5 states that an aborted(due to LUN_RESET) TMR should not be
responded to initiator:

7.11 Task management function lifetime
 The task management function shall exist until:
  a) the task manager sends a service response for the task management function;
  b) an I_T nexus loss (see 6.3.4);
* c) a logical unit reset (see 6.3.3);
  d) a hard reset (see 6.3.2);
  e) power loss expected (see 6.3.5); or
  f) a power on condition (see 6.3.1)

 Dmitry
