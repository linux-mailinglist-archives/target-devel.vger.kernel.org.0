In fact every subset can be a subject to argue :) 
* RTPI patchset - changing data model from RTPI-set on backstore device
to RTPI-set on a whole node.
* PR refactoring - to much changes, may be APTPL changes are not
  backward compatible
* remote/dummy fabric - name 
* DLM_CKV - name, place and even a meaning of the module
* tcm_cluster - too much new exported symbols, not resistant to
  node death in between of storing PR data in DLM_CKV and other error
  cases.

After approve of the idea I can break the patch set to several ones
and start to post it without RFC prefix. The only problem is that they
all depend on previous ones. So I have to post each after the previous
gets merged.

I am not going to share this patchset to nvmet dev list :)
nvmet does not yet have a local version of CompareAndWrite and
Reservations features, so it is too early for them.
