I thought it over one more time.

1. To not report empty port group is a completely backward compatible
change becasue there is no impact on userspace at all. The only change
is in the network response.

2. SPC-4 ("5.15.2.7 Target port asymmetric access state reporting")
tells that a target MAY not provide info about port groups that do not
contain the current port through that the RTPG is received. 

So, according to SPC it is expected behaviour to not report the empty
port groups.

I will prepare new version of the patch with always skipping any empty
port group in RTPG response.

BR,
 Dmitry
