I know that the ESXi 7.0 requests the 8Fh VPD page. ESXi is one of
a few initiators who is using the XCOPY commands (vmkfstools tool).

After activating XCOPY in a target we got an error from
the SCSI.ReceiveCopyResults.CopyStatus test in the libiscsi.
Discussing with Bart, we decided to implement the 8Fh VPD page
for announcing TCM XCOPY features.
It is here: https://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi/pull/353

The libiscsi has an initial version for parsing 8Fh VPD. This is used
in the SCSI.ReceiveCopyResults.CopyStatus test. It is a good idea
to add test coverage for 8Fh VPD in libiscsi. I should do this.

I thought about it, but spc_emulate_evpd_XX functions have a prototype:
	sense_reason_t	(*emulate)(struct se_cmd *, unsigned char *);
and they don't know anything about buffer length. I can use the
"SE_INQUIRY_BUF" definition, but I don't like this solution.
=09
We can change the prototype of spc_emulate_evpd_XX functions, like:
	static struct {
		uint8_t page;
		sense_reason_t	(*emulate)(struct se_cmd *, unsigned char *buf, size_t len=
);
	} evpd_handlers[] =3D {
		...
	};
and return the TCM_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if we try to overrun buffer
in spc_emulate_evpd_XX. But this will require changing all "emulate_evpd" f=
unctions.

David, what do you think of this?
