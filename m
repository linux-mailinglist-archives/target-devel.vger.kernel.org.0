I was thinking about this some more and we could do the following:

1. When userspace creates a target or tpg, it tells the kernel if it =
supports the updated session interface.
2. If userspace supports it, when we create a session we get a reference =
to the tpg with configfs_depend_item(). And create the sysfs interface. =
We might actually be able to do confifgfs.
3. On tpg deletion, if at #1 it has told us it supports the new =
interface then userspace just has to tear down the sessions by doing a =
rmdir on the sessions if we do configfs or write to some new delete file =
if we use sysfs.=
