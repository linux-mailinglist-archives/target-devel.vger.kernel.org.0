Just answering my own question. It looks like we do not get stuck. But
we either get nothing on the session so the login timeout fires and we
drop the session. Or, we get a PDU and the login thread reads it in
before the normal rx thread does, but it assumes it is a login related
and we most likely drop the session due to invalid fields.

I think in iscsi_target_restore_sock_callbacks we want to do a:

cancel_delayed_work(&conn->login_work)

after we reset the callbacks and drop the sk_callback_lock lock.
