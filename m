We may want to discuss whether TARGET_SCF_LOOKUP_LUN_FROM_TAG should be
removed entirely. As you said, qla2xxx is the only user of this
feature. And it actually uses it only in a single code path, 
__qlt_24xx_handle_abts() (everywhere else the LUN is known beforehand,
AFAICT).

If you look at the code of __qlt_24xx_handle_abts(), you can see that
it calls tcm_qla2xxx_find_cmd_by_tag(), which does the same thing
as target_lookup_lun_from_tag(): iterate over se_sess->sess_cmd_list
until a matching tag is found. It would clearly be equivalent, and more
efficient, if qla2xxx set the lun directly rather than relying on
common code iterating through the same list again, later.
