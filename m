What's a special case vs normal?

I would agree having a SCSI HBA in your system and having it setup 
during system boot up is normal.

I would agree hardware failing is special.

Having a remote client connect to us, lose its connected then recover 
seems special, because it's a failure case.

Even the initial connection seems like a special event, because the user 
has done some extra steps to have the client connect to us. It's like 
adding a new disk to the system which we log today or like plugging in 
or removing a USB device which we also log.

I do, but I'm a kernel developer :)

For the sys admin and distro debugging type of case, yes, they want this 
type of thing logged, because they have done some extra setup to have a 
remote client connect to us. When the connection is lost and then 
re-added they want all that info logged with the lower level info we are 
already logging, so they can follow the time of events.
