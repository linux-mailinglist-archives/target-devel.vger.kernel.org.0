Hi Roman,

Interesting, thanks.

I don't object to that. FWIW, the following crude metrics could be seen
as an argument in favour of SPC-4 versioning:
  linux> git grep -ic -e "SPC4" -e "SPC-4" -- drivers/target/
  drivers/target/target_core_alua.c:7
  drivers/target/target_core_alua.h:5
  drivers/target/target_core_device.c:1
  drivers/target/target_core_fabric_lib.c:5
  drivers/target/target_core_pr.c:37
  drivers/target/target_core_spc.c:19
  drivers/target/target_core_tmr.c:3
  drivers/target/target_core_transport.c:2
  drivers/target/target_core_ua.c:1
  drivers/target/target_core_ua.h:1
  drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c:3
  drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.h:1
  linux> git grep -ic -e "SPC3" -e "SPC-3" -- drivers/target/
  drivers/target/target_core_alua.c:1
  drivers/target/target_core_configfs.c:14
  drivers/target/target_core_pr.c:75
  drivers/target/target_core_spc.c:4
  drivers/target/target_core_tmr.c:1
  drivers/target/target_core_transport.c:4
  drivers/target/target_core_ua.c:1

Most of the SPC3 target_core_pr and target_core_configfs matches above
are debug/error messages, rather than spec references.

Cheers, David
