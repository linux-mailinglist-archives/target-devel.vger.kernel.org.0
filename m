Yeah, that sounds good.

Just to make sure I am on the same page as you and Jason about what 
patches are features vs fixes/cleanups. I'm thinking patches 1 - 11 are 
to resend in the fixes patchset?

0. Patches 1 - 2 are adding helpers I use later.

1. Patches 3 - 8 are related to fixing IO errors due to the VM sending 
virtqueue_size/cmd_per_lun commands but vhost-scsi having 256 hard coded.

Patch:

[PATCH 08/17] vhost scsi: alloc cmds per vq instead of session

is what fixes the issue in vhost-scsi so we allocate enough resource to 
match what the VM is going to send us, but is built on patches 3 - 7 
which allow vhost-scsi to know which vqs to allocate cmd resrouces for.

[PATCH 03/17] vhost net: use goto error handling in open
[PATCH 04/17] vhost: prep vhost_dev_init users to handle failures
[PATCH 05/17] vhost: move vq iovec allocation to dev init time
[PATCH 06/17] vhost: support delayed vq creation
[PATCH 07/17] vhost scsi: support delayed IO vq creation

2. Patch 9 fixes a race where we signal userspace the cmd is done before 
we were done with it. We can then get IO errors if the VM sends a new IO 
before we free up the old cmd.


3. Patch 10 adds LUN reset support. Currently, if the real/backing 
device hits a temp issue, the VM's scsi/block layer cmd timer might fire 
and send a reset. We don't implement this, so we just fail. The VM's 
device goes offline and the app in the VM gets IO errors.

4. Patch 11 removes extra flush calls.


Patches 12 - 17 are adding support for the thread per VQ which is a perf 
feature so resend them separately when we figure what is best.
