Hi linux target comminity.

Let's me present RFC of an implementation of cluster features for Target
Core that needs for backstore devices shared through cluster nodes.

The patchset is big and of several subsets, but it contains some arguable
things and it would take too much time to discsuss them separatelly.

Patches 1-9:
Make RTPI be part of se_tpg instead of se_lun. That is a must because
there is no possibility to assign RTPI on a LUN.
That data model is different from SCST and current in LIO but still does
not contradict with SAM and even is more according to SAM - a whole TCM
is a SCSI Device, and all its ports are SCSI Ports with unique RTPIs.
 + unique identification of TPG through the cluster.
 + possibility of assignment of RPTI.
 - number of all TPGs will be limited to 65535.
This patchset was published first time 2 years ago [1]. In previous
version the peers RTPIs were put in <device>/alua/... folder. In this
version the peers RTPIs are part of TPGs on the remote fabric (patch 35).

Patches 10-29:
Fixes some bugs and deviations from the standard in PR code.
Undepend pr_reg from se_nacl and se_tpg to be just a registration holder.
Make APTPL registrations (not linked to se_dev_entry) be full-fledged
registrations.

Patches 30-34:
DLM_CKV module that uses DLM and provides:
 * Cluster Lock service (pure wrapper over DLM).
 * Cluster Key-Value service in memory storage.
 * Cluster Notification service with a blocking acknowledge.
 * Cluster membership callbacks.
This module is supposed to be used by TCM and nvmet to implement cluster
operations.

Patch 35:
New 'remote' (in fact dummy) fabric module. Configuration on this fabric will
provide to TCM a view of TPG/LUN/ACL configuration on a peer nodes.

Patche 36:
Introduce cluster ops and functions to register a cluster ops
implementation modules. There could be a several different modules.
The device attrib cluster_impl regulates which implementation to use
for that device. 'single' is for default (no cluster) implementation.

Patches 37-48:
TCM Cluster over DLM module implementation inspired by SCST.
 * Use DLM_CKV Lock service to serialize order of PR OUT commands
 * Use DLM_CKV Key-Value storage service to store PR cluster data.
Sync it after successful execution of PR OUT command.
 * Use DLM_CKV Notification service to notify (in blocking manner) other
nodes to fetch PR cluster data. The handling of PR OUT command is
blocked until other nodes read the cluster PR data.

It provides:
 * Cluster lock per LBA for Compare And Write.
 * Full support of SCSI-3 Persistent Reservations including
   PREEMPT AND ABORT and REGISTER AND MOVE.
 * Normal PR APTPL imlementation (persistanse over power loss)
 * Shared LUN RESET
 * Shared SCSI-2 Reservations.
 * Unit Attentions for all TPGs in cluster




How to test

1. Setup DLM over worked corosync & pacemaker cluster
 $ zypper install libdlm libdlm3
 $ crm configure primitive dlm ocf:pacemaker:controld args="-q0 -f0" allow_stonith_disabled=true  op monitor interval="60" timeout="60"
 $ crm configure clone clone-dlm dlm meta interleave=true target-role=Started
2. setup TCM cluster configuration
You can use my script [2] that I used to use while developing the patchset.
3. Test what you want.
For example, my test report [3].
