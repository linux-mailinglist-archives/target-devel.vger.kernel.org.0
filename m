Maybe I don't get it. What I meant is:

Creation of the "sessions" folders in tpg and acl has to be done by
user.
If user creates a new acl while tpg is active, the acl immediately
becomes active, I think.
If user then creates the "sessions" folder, it could happen that
a session already is started meanwhile. That session would be
invisible then.
Maybe an "enable" attr for acl would help?

We then bring down the objects under it like luns, portals, etc. When we get to sessions, if the target has not yet brought them down (some targets do this on tpg disablement and some do not), then with that github patch rtslib will kill them like it does for the other objects.

Ahh, I see.




Let me resend another part of my response, that was far down:

Why is the cfgfs_sess_supp flag per tpg? It seems to be set if either
tpg/sessions or any acl/sessions folder is created.
So what will happen here if e.g session for an acl is created while
only tpg/sessions exists?
Do we need an similar flag per acl also?
And if we have a per acl and the tpg flag I think they should be removed
when user removes an empty sessions folder.

Do we have a possible race here? I think it would be better to first
call target_depend_item() and then register the new session's group.
