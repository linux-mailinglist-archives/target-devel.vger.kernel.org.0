Hi Roman,

During the merge window many maintainers and core contributors are busy 
with identifying and addressing regressions introduced during the merge 
window. I think that is why the merge window is not the best time to 
post patches and why that text was added to the kernel documentation.

What happens with patches posted during the merge window depends on the 
maintainer (Martin Petersen). Sometimes patches posted during the merge 
window are ignored. Sometimes such patches are queued after the merge 
window has closed. Sometimes contributors are asked after the merge 
window has closed to rebase their patch series, to retest it and to 
repost it. The latter makes sense because the changes accepted during 
the merge window (e.g. core kernel API changes) may require matching 
changes in a patch series. You may want to ask Martin directly which 
approach he prefers after the merge window has closed.

Bart.
