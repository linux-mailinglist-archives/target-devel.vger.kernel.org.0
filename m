Hi Finn,

I am confident that my estimate is an accurate estimate since I have not
seen any sbp support requests, sbp bug reports nor any sbp bug fixes since
the sbp target driver has been accepted upstream.

Yes. If anyone wants to change the interface between SCSI target core and
SCSI target drivers, all target drivers, including the sbp and FCoE target
driver have to be retested. In other words, keeping unused target drivers
inside the kernel tree involves a significant maintenance burden for anyone
who wants to modify the interface between the SCSI target core and SCSI
target drivers.

Additionally, there is a good alternative available for the sbp driver.
Every system I know of that is equipped with a Firewire port also has an
Ethernet port. So users who want to provide SCSI target functionality on
such systems can use any SCSI transport protocol that is compatible with
Ethernet (iSCSI, iSER over soft-RoCE, SRP over soft-RoCE, ...).

Thanks,

Bart.
