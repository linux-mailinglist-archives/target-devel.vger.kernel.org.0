Actually, this patch even fixes a crash that we've just faced.
The second LUN_RESET moves the first LUN_RESET from tmr_list to its
drain_tmr_list, then the first LUN_RESET removes itself from second`s
drain_tmr_list, then the second LUN_RESET tries to remove the first from
the list and crashes because it was deleted already.
So,
