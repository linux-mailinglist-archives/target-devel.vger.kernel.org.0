Right now yes. In the patch I started to try to support a per tpg mix. If a session exists then you do mkdir sessions, then before you can delete the tpg you have to delete the sessions that were created after the mkdir.

But to handle all the side cases, it becomes a pain, and I don't think anyone will ever use that feature, so I plan to make it either on or off for all sessions on the tpg and no mixing. I think normally we see different tools at the per target or per fabric level, so we should be ok.

Yes.

No. It works the same as today. When you do a tpg removal like when you do

targetlci clearconfig

rtslib disables the tpg which prevents the target from creating new sessions. We then bring down the objects under it like luns, portals, etc. When we get to sessions, if the target has not yet brought them down (some targets do this on tpg disablement and some do not), then with that github patch rtslib will kill them like it does for the other objects.
