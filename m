OTOH, uio does try_module_get(idev->owner) in uio_open before calling
the driver's open callback and module_put(idev_owner) in uio_release
after calling driver's release callback. So driver's release callback
is guaranteed to exist until last release is done.

Apart from that, tcmu also has an uio_info::mmap callback. In that
callback it installs its own vm_operations_struct::fault handler.
This handler also can happen to be called as long as userspace holds
the uio device mmap'ed. I think, this is not a problem due to the
above mentioned mechanism.

tcmu just has to ensure, that the tcmu device, which contains the 
uio_info - is kept until the final release call happens. Unfortunately
this call will not happen if uio device is open during
uio_unregister_device. That's why tcmu sometimes leaks memory.

I'm not sure I get your point.

That's why I tried to change uio in a compatible way, so other drivers
based on it are not afflicted by the change. I saw, that some drivers
based on uio free their resources directly after calling
uio_unregister_device. Executing their release callback later would
definitely cause trouble.

Why tcmu driver is based on uio I don't know. I inherited the driver as
it is. Maybe it would have been better to not base it on uio, I don't
know. But changing this now would cause an API change for all existing
userspace apps, e.g. tcmu-runner. I think I should avoid that and
therefore have to find an acceptable solution for the tcmu/uio
combination.
