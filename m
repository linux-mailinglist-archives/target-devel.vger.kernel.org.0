Hi Roman,

Maybe I'm overly concerned. I do not know for sure which applications
rely on the current behavior of residual handling. All I know about
these applications is based on what others wrote about these
applications. An example from
https://www.t10.org/pipermail/t10/2003-November/009317.html: "We have
customers who also use overlength and underlength transfers as a normal
mode of operation."

An additional question is what behavior other operating systems than
Linux expect? There are probably setups in which another operating
system than Linux communicates with a LIO SCSI target?

Thanks,

Bart.
