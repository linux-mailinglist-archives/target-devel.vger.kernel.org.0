Why are you using the scsi sysfs interface instead of the target
configfs interface?

I know the comment for max_lun says it wants to support 1 LUN, but the
code like in tcm_loop_port_link seems to support multiple LUNs, so your
patch looks like it could be ok. I would just set max_luns to the kernel
(scsi-ml/lio) limit and not some userspace value.

I think the only problem you might have with your patch is that if you
delete the device via the scsi sysfs interface you will not be able to
unmap the LUN from LIO until you add it back due to tcm_loop_port_unlink
failing to look up the device and being able to decrement the tpg refcount.
