Yes.

Sure, it's going to be rare. Systems using isert targets with
infiniband are going to be naturally rare. It's part of why I left the
max_cmd_sn behavior untouched for non-isert iscsit since they seem to
be fine as is. But it's easily and regularly triggered by some systems
which use isert, so worth fixing.

If it waits indefinitely for an allocation it ends up with a variation
of the original problem under memory pressure. If it waits for
allocation on isert receive, then receive stalls under memory pressure
and won't process the completions which would have released the other
iscsi_cmd structs just needing final acknowledgement.
