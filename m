I didn't get this. If only the backend is backed up then we should
still be transmitting the data out/R2Ts quickly and we shouldn't be
hitting the issue where we got stuck waiting on them.

Ah I think we were talking about different things here. I thought you meant
users and I was just saying they wouldn't see a difference. But for ESXi
it's going to work differently than I was thinking. I thought the initiator
was going to escalate to LUN RESET then we hit the issue I mention
below in the FastAbort part of the mail where we end up dropping the
connection waiting on the data outs.

I didn't get this part where the connection is dropped almost immediately.
If only the backend is backed up, what is dropping the connection right
away? The data out timers shouldn't be firing right? It sounds like above
the network between the initiator and target were ok so data outs and R2Ts
should be executing quickly like normal right?

I think maybe you are replying about aborts, but I was asking about
LUN RESET which is opposite but will also hit the same hang if the
connection is dropped after one is sent.

For aborts it works like you wrote above. For LUN RESET it's opposite.
In 3270, it doesn't say how to handle aborts, but on the pdl lists it
came up and they said equivalent of your nuke it. However, for TMFs
that affect multiple tasks they clarified it in later versions of the
specs.

In the original it only says how to handle abort/clear task set, but in

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5048

the behavior was clarified and in 7143 we have the original/default
way:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7143#section-4.2.3.3

which says to wait for the data outs.

And then we have FastAbort which is nuke it:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7143#section-4.2.3.4

So here I was saying I don't think anyone implemented the ability to
negotiate for TaskReporting=FastAbort, so most might do the original behavior.
If that's right then we just end up dropping the connection for windows and
linux and newer versions of ESXi if that session drop setting is set
(I can't remember the setting), when they end up timing out their TMFs.
