Do you mean an interface like a blocking ioctl(vhost_fd,
VHOST_WORKER_RUN) where the vhost processing is done in the context of
the caller's userspace thread?

What is neat about this is that it removes thread configuration from the
kernel vhost code. On the other hand, userspace still needs an interface
indicating which vqs should be processed. Maybe it would even require an
int worker_fd =3D ioctl(vhost_fd, VHOST_WORKER_CREATE) and then
ioctl(worker_fd, VHOST_WORKER_BIND_VQ, vq_idx)? So then it becomes
complex again...
