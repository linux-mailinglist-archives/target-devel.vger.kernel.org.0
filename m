We are talking about different things here. Above I'm just asking about what
leads to the cmd timeout.

You wrote before the abort is sent the backend gets backed up, and the back
up causes IO to take long enough for the initiator cmd timeout to fire.
I'm asking why before the initiator side cmd timeout and before the abort is sent,
why aren't R2T/data_outs executing quickly if only the backend is backed up?

Is it the bug I mentioned where one of the iscsi threads is stuck on the
submission to the block layer, so that thread can't handle iscsi IO?
If so I have a patch for that.

I get that once the abort is sent we hit these other issues.

Are you using iscsi in the VM or in the hypervisor? For the latter is
timeout 15 seconds for normal READs/WRITEs? What version of ESXi?

Where do you see "ABORT TASK" in there? That RFC chunk from 4.2.3.3;

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7143#section-4.2.3.3

lists the TMFs it covers:

The execution of ABORT TASK SET, CLEAR TASK SET, LOGICAL UNIT RESET, TARGET
WARM RESET, and TARGET COLD RESET TMF  Requests

But in the link, the "SET" part of "ABORT TASK SET" is on the next line so
you might have just scanned over it wrong.

Linux is wrong for different reasons and was why I was saying initiators
just did not do things right and you can get a crazy mix of behavior.
I basically programed it for how targets were working and not being strict
RFC wise.

1. For aborts, it will send the abort then not send anything else.

2. For LUN/target resets, it "sort of" does FastAbort. I wrote the linux
code before FastAbort was a thing so it's all messed up. Basically, we
send the LUN RESET, then the default is to just stop sending DataOuts
for WRITEs.

However, we implemented that code before RFC 7143 so we don't negotiate
for TaskReporting. It's just a iscsid.conf setting node.session.iscsi.FastAbort.
