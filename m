So is the answer to my question a maybe but it probably will never =
happen?

If the user has multiple backend devices with the same serial, then your =
patch would now return error right? Is the reason that this patch is a =
RFC to try and figure out if that case is valid or ever happens? If so, =
the only way I could see that happening on purpose is if someone was =
trying to bypass a device issue.

For example, I create 2 tcmu devices. They both point to the same real =
device. Then export dev1 through target port1 and dev2 through target =
port2. Each tcmu device would then have it=E2=80=99s own data/cmd ring =
and locking, so you do not hit those perf issues. I do this for perf =
testing. I don=E2=80=99t think that type of thing is common or ever =
done, so I think the patch would be ok if that is a concern and it=E2=80=99=
s better than possible data corruption.

Code wise it looks ok to me.
