Because that's pretty much the worst of all worlds: If the driver is
simply going orphaned it can stay where it is to avoid confusion.  If
it's being removed, it's better to remove it from where it is because
that makes the patch to restore it easy to find.

Chris, the thing is this: if this driver has just one user on a stable
distro who complains about its removal six months to two years from
now, Linus will descend on us from a great height (which won't matter
to you, since you'll be long gone).  This makes everyone very wary of
outright removal.  If you're really, really sure it has no users, it
can be deleted, but if there's the slightest chance it has just one, it
should get orphaned.
