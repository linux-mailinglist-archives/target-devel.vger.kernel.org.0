If we removed the clearing of idev->info in uio_unregister_device, and
then moved the idev->info->release call from uio_release to
uio_device_release it would work like you need right? The release callback
would always be called and called when userspace has dropped it's refs.
You need to also fix up the module refcount and some other bits because
it looks like uio uses the uio->info check to determine if the device is
being removed.

I don't know if that is the correct approach. It looks like non
target_core_user drivers could hit a similar issue. It seems like drivers
like qedi/bnx2i could hit the issue if their port is removed from the
kernel before their uio daemon closes the device. However, they also
could do a driver specific fix and handle the issue by adding some extra
kernel/userspace bits to sync the port removal.
