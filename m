Precisely.

Relogin fails as there is I/O outstanding on the original session, and 
you try to relogin into the same session. Which is still busy, hence you 
cannot login.

And I/O is outstanding as it can't be aborted, as the only transport 
implementing abort is target_core_user.c; for all the others you are 
screwed.
