OK, so can't you do it like a vdso then?  For them we detect on mmap
what the architectural model is and map different areas depending on
that, so effectively you have a 64 and a 32 bit layout area and which
one you map depends on the architecture type you see coming into the
setup call.  You expect only one to be mapped and you only do extra
conversions on the impedance mismatch case.

I forget if the vdso switch is exposed outside the architecture, but an
inspection of the code should tell you.

The userspace application absolutely knows its binary model.  The
kernel sort of knows (its known in the ELF32 execution model and the
like).

Well, yes, but that's an ABI change which I thought you were trying to
avoid?
