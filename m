Hi,

I have a weird issue with using a file as backing store with a Win2016 server as initiator. 

Very often if I reboot the Linux server the disk image becomes corrupt so that Windows cannot even detect the gpt partition table on it. It can happen even if I shut down the Windows machine before I reboot the Linux server.

Initially I thought I would be write cache. But I've disabled that with no benefit to this problem. 

There are no errors in dmesg except initially when loading the target. Perhaps I'm doing wrong when rebooting?

The LIO target is running Fedora 33 Server with two Seagate Exos 10TB in Btrfs RAID-1 mode.

Are there any debugging options that would help?

Thanks for any advice.
