I fear that would not work, because uio_release must be called always,
no matter whether userspace closes the device before or after
uio_unregister_device.

But we could add a new callback pointer 'late_release' to struct
uio_info and struct uio_device. During uio_register_device we would
copy the pointer from info to idev.

If info == NULL, uio_release calls idev->late_release if != NULL.

tcmu would of course set info->release and ->late_release both to
tcmu_release.

I had a closer look into qedi. I assume there might be a leak also,
because qedi_uio_close calls "qedi_ll2_free_skbs(qedi)".

Unfortunately my above proposal would not work here without adding a
new refcount to qedi_uio_dev, because currently in __qedi_free_uio
the udev is freed shortly after uio_unregister_device. So later calls
of qedi_uio_close(udev) would be harmful.

But I guess the leak can be fixed by adding two lines after the
uio_unregister_device() in __qedi_free_uio:

	if (test_bit(UIO_DEV_OPENED, &udev->qedi->flags)
		qedi_ll2_free_skbs(qedi);
