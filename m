Short answer: you can't.

There is no feasible path in the I/O stack to abort running I/O; the
only chance you have here is to wait for it to time-out.

We have run into similar issues, and found that the only sane solution
was to wait for the I/O to come back and then retry.
As this would take some time (30 seconds if you are unlucky) most
initiators will get unhappy and try to reset.
Which won't work, either, as the I/O is still stuck.
So we finally delayed relogin until all I/O was cleared.

Not the best solution, but the only thing we can do in the absense of a
proper I/O abort mechanism.

Cheers,

Hannes
