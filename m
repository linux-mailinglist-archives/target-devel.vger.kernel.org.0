We stuck waiting on them because the initiator will not send Data-Out
PDUs after sending ABORT TASK:

  1. Initiator sends WRITE CDB
  2. Target sends R2T
  3. Almost immediately Initiator decides to abort the request and sends
     ABORT TASK without sending any further Data-Out PDUs (maybe except for
     the first one); I believe it happens because the initiator tries to
     abort a larger batch of requests, and this unlucky request is just
     the last in series
  4. Target still waits for Data-Out PDUs and times out on Data-Out timer

The problem is that between #3 and #4 there is no code that will
actually abort the task, meaning stopping the Data-Out timer, sending
the responses if TAS is requires and so on.

I was talking about the patch you proposed. Waiting for the Data-Out
timeout means that the reconnection will be triggered. And this creates
duality of a sort. If ABORT TASK was issued after we received all the
Data-Out PDUs, the target will wait for the WRITE request to complete.
But if we didn't receive them, the target will just wait unless the
Data-Out timer expires and close the session.

For Target it says the following even for ABORT TASK:

  a) MUST wait for responses on currently valid Target Transfer Tags
     of the affected tasks from the issuing initiator. MAY wait for
     responses on currently valid Target Transfer Tags of the affected
     tasks from third-party initiators.

So either ESXi violates the RFC or just not RFC7143 compliant. However
I'm getting hit with this even on Linux. I'll try to get some TCP dumps.

Hmm... I'll check how long the initiator actually waits before killing
the connection.
