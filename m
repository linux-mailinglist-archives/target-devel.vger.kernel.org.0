Looks like it is a FC term :) "Completion" there is a confirmation that
a response has been received by a peer and a driver can free its
resources now. A failed completion due to network error (logout for
instance) is a completion too.
Under "iSCSI does not complete responses in case of connection closed"
I meant that iscsi_target does nothing if tcm_core queues a
response/status when iscsi connection is closed already. It does not
"complete" the queued response by decrementing kref by
target_put_sess_cmd like in normal case.

I reproduced that bug by simple test case:
1. Export scsi_debug (with 30s delay) device to Initiator on 2 paths
2. On initiator:
  # make the first IO do some initial IO traffic on the disk to make the
  # second dd to send just one READ_10 command.
  dd if=/dev/sda iflag=direct of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1
  # start 1 IO on the first path that will hang forever eventually
  dd if=/dev/sda iflag=direct of=/dev/null bs=512 count=1 &
  sleep 1
  # LUN_RESET on the second path, to make TAS feature send a response
  # for the command from the first path
  sg_reset -d /dev/sdb &
3. On target:
  # simulate local connection reinstatement (like on DataOut timeout)
  echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/iscsi/iqn/tpg0/enable

In that scenario the connection will be already closed at the moment of
target_handle_abort => queue_status(), iscsi_target will not free that
cmd at the connection closing because that command is CMD_T_ABORTED and
tcm_core will endlessly wait for "completion" of the queued response.

That is that another bug that is not addressed in my patch because it is
really another bug.
My patch fixes only unableness of relogin (due to aborted WRITE_PENDING
commands) that was really catched by our customers. I believe that it
make sense to have it in 5.20.

For RecoveryLevel > 0, I even get a crash on cmd->conn dereference at
lio_queue_status() -> iscsit_add_cmd_to_response_queue().
So, that another bug "TAS when connection is closed" is a complex issue
and to be addressed separatelly.

I saw somewhen that patch, but did not tested it. And it does not fixes
that crash too.
