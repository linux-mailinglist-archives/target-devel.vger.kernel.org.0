I was thinking about that, but there is some TAS code that requires the
proper response from the aborted command. Also the ABORT TASK execution
path kinda allows ABORT TASK to be aborted itself. I'm not sure if
that's code has any meaning now, but if it does, then clearing WRITE_10
early may not be a valid action from the SCSI protocol point of view.
