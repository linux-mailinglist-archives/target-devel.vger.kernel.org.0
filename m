If I understand you correctly, you're talking about the very different
case where bios sent to a backend's block device get stuck. True, we can
do little in that case. In this case, however, there are no bios yet,
TCM is still waiting for the data from the initiator. We can do anything
we want here, because at this point TCM has complete control over the
request execution.
