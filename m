Hi Bart,

iSCSI doesn't specify a specific code but mentions a possibility of CHECK
CONDITION for residuals (11.4.5.1.  Field Semantics):

  Targets may set the residual count, and initiators may use it when the
  response code is Command Completed at Target (even if the status
  returned is not GOOD).

I have skimmed over SRP and haven't found if it's explicitly disallowed
to send CHECK CONDITION for READ/WRITEs with residuals.

Typical use case for CHECK CONDITION in case of Underflow/Overflow is
extra robustness against buggy initiators [1][2]. Failing both READ and
WRITE is the most solid approach in that sense [3][4][5] as it prevents
data corruption at all costs.

Suppose an initiator wants to WRITE 8 LBA. For 512-byte formatted LUN,
8 LBAs need a buffer of 4K bytes. For 4096-byte formatted LUN the
command would need 32K data buffer.

An Overflow happens if initiator treats 4Kn device like 512n one but
provides a buffer of 4K. i.e. to complete the WRITE target needs to
consume 28K more data, otherwise only 1 LBA would be written and the
rest 7 LBAs would have indeterminate content.

An Underflow happens if initiator confuses 512n device with 4Kn one and
provides a buffer of 32K, i.e. target doesn't utilize all buffer for the
command.

It might be true but there are no public tests for FC. We're planning to
extend libiscsi using SG_IO v4 to cover more corner cases, like FC
residuals and aborts/error recovery. Also, SLER (Sequence level error
recovery) is comming to FCP-5/FC-NVMe-2, it be useful to test it too.
