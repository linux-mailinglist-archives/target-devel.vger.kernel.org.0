Thanks for the links. I haven't seen ESXi attempt to use it, but also
haven't checked for some time. It'd be good to get some of this
information in the commit message.

I'm probably missing something, but why wasn't the 3PC flag in the
standard inquiry page an option for this check?

Okay, fair enough.

That's checking the amount copied into the response buffer. My concern
is the prior writes to the staging buf.
