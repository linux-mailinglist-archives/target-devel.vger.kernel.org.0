Thanks. Please put this in the commit message.

Ideally inquiry and mode sense handlers, not to mention the configfs
callbacks, would all carry explicit bounds checks. As a start I'd be
fine with buflen=SE_INQUIRY_BUF at the top of spc_emulate_evpd_8f(), but
any further steps towards doing it properly would be helpful IMO.
