Hi Maurizio,

Yes per-session file would work. I think about sessions directory in
debugfs (/sys/kernel/debug/target/sessions/<session-name>) with the
following contents:

  * "info" file that contains aggregated information about a
    session

  * per-command directories named after command tag where we can inspect
    every command in se_sess_map of the session

    * "info" file for the command that would allow to read exact command
      state including transport-specific details and probably command
      addresses.

The reason why debugfs is preferred over configfs is the following.
There could be cases where configfs entries couldn't be destroyed due to
a command stuck in the session. In the case we can't read configfs and
have no fallback way to figure out the reason of the TCM lock-up. All
commands to access the session might hang.

If we create debugfs sessions entry right after session init and destroy
it just before session is freed. Then we can read it while the session
as long as it's alive.

Reading from "<session>/<tag>/info" needs to be consistent but shouldn't
have an impact on the hot path. We might need to introduce tag/se_cmd
generation for each command in the session. The generation is increased
on every get_tag()/command allocation. That'd allow printing routine to
detect that content of the debugfs is stale and read should be
retried/EAGAIN or aborted.

It's very raw thoughts but hopefully I'll come up with something that
assists in session debugging.

Regards,
Roman
